## Common Questions

**Q: Why do you need Full Disk Access?**
A: macOS requires this permission to read Voice Memos. Without it, no app can access your recordings.

**Q: Is my data safe?**
A: Yes! The app works completely offline. It just reads your Voice Memos and copies the ones you select.

**Q: What if I have files with the same name?**
A: The app automatically adds numbers to avoid overwriting files.
