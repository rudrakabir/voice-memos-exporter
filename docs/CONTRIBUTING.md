We love your input! We want to make contributing to Voice Memos Exporter as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Local Development
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate virtual environment: 
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - Unix/MacOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the application: `python src/main.py`
